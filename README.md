# Virtual Rubiks Cube
Virtual Rubiks cube built in NetLogo using 2d points and some neat math to make it appear 3d. I made this project because I wanted to try out and better understand some how t work with 3d graphics in NetLogo (and I love Rubiks cubes!).

Try it out [here](https://123xxgamer.github.io/rubiks-cube-sim/rubiksCube.html)!

Note that unfortunately some features do not work on the web version and only work on a local version running in NetLogo.
